Test task for DevCom

Notice board with all requirements completed. Added Google Identity authentification
ClientId and ClientSecret from Google Identity left in NoticeBoard.Web->appsettings.json for posibility to test it localy, but its also set on Azure in Environment Variables so it can be removed from appsettings.json and still work on Azure
Although I realise that its not secure to put such data on GitHub

Application is deployed on Azure and available by link: https://noticeboard-fggcfjeqf6f3gmbd.polandcentral-01.azurewebsites.net/

Application uses older version of .net due to my PC specifications
